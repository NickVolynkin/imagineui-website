Page
====

Usage
------

Start every scene with ``Page`` keyword and a name:

..  code-block:: imagineui

    Page "Signup"
    Block "Top menu"
        ...
    Block "Personal data"
        ...
    Block "Footer"

The page's name is there just for you to remember what each scene is about.
It does not appear on the rendered mockup.

Word order and capitalization are optional.
Use it to your convenience:

..  code-block:: imagineui

    "Signup" page
    ...
